Introduction.
This is my Introduction to Mobile Development practicum exam and welcome to my Music Playlist Manager Application. I have been given the task to create an Android Application using Kotlin in Android Studio. This application makes use of arrays, loops, and screen navigation.

An explanation of the Main Screen:
The Main Screen’s heading is My Music Manager App. The app display consists of a Text View welcome text explaining what the user must do. There is a button written “Add a playlist”, a second button written View and a third button written Exit. When the user clicks the “Add a playlist” button, the user will be asked to enter the song details for the playlist and the songs details. (College, 2025)

An explanation of my Detailed View Screen:

The Detailed View Screen’s heading will also be My Music Manager App. The app’s display consists of button written List of songs that when clicked should display the list of songs with the corresponding details, a second button written Average Rating that when clicked should calculate and display the average rating, a third button written Return to Main Screen and a text view box that should display the output needed (College, 2025)

A Features Summary:

•	This app uses parallel arrays for the songs, artists, ratings and comments.
•	This app includes loops for listing and averaging.
•	This app uses navigation between two screens.
•	This app includes error handling for inputs.
•	This app allows a playlist addition and average rating calculation.
